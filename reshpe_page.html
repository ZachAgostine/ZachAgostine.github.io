            <h3>Fun fact, bicycles are shipped with packaging material just like every other product. Folks like me are hired to assemble those bikes and strip off all the waste before they're seen by the public. My bike shop didn't have access to single stream recycling, so these plastic parts were being thrown away - and I took that personally. <br>
            The waste that comes with these bikes is polypropyline - a thermoplastic that is relitivly safe to work with. With my junk toaster oven and plywood mold, I began making 6" x 6" sheets. Once cooled, these sheets could be shaped and assembled just like wood. And thus, the first planters where born! </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Recently, the kind folks at The Innovation Barn in Charlotte have allowed me to use their equipment to ramp up production. In just 5 days, I to processed 40 lbs of waste down to 1/4 in flake - the ideal size for efficent heating and reshaping. Soon, I'll be able to produce polypropyline planters efficently and consistantly - allowing me to begin selling and collecting more waste steams! <br>

										<h2>Phase 1 <br> Working with plastic.</h2>
										<h3>The cool thing about plastic is that it can be heated to fasten it to other plastic pieces, removing the need for traditional fasteners like screws or adhesive. So I began experamenting with the best ways to use heat to connect 4 walls with a base. <br>
										I started with traditional woodworking tecniques, such as box joints and japanese joinery. The results were mixed, and still required extensive post proccessing to ensure all seams were sealed. </h3>

										<h2>Phase 2 - Make it work people<br> 
										<h3>At The Innovation Barn, I encountered my first problem - the compression screw ratio was not high enough to enable injection molding. What is could do was extrude a 3mm line of filament, so I made it work. Using my mold as a basic shape, I wrapped filament around for a solid hour, resulting is a functional planter that looks like a birds nest. <br>
											The results were better than expected - patrons said they loved the texture, going so far as to say these looked better than the platers I was expecting to make. <br>
											This is why all schools need funding for the arts.</h3>

										I founded this startup with a singlular goal - less waste, more plants. To date I've recycled just over 3kg of polypropeline and PLA into planters.<br>
										I've since teamed up with The Innovation Barn in Charlotte to further this goal. Click the image for more plant pictures!</h2>
