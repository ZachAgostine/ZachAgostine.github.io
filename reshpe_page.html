						<h1>reShape PlasticWorks</h1>
            <h3>Fun fact, bicycles are shipped with packaging material just like every other product. Folks like me are hired to assemble those bikes and strip off all the waste before they're seen by the public. My bike shop didn't have access to single stream recycling, so these plastic parts were being thrown away - and I took that personally. <br>
            The waste that comes with these bikes is polypropyline - a thermoplastic that is relitivly safe to work with. With my junk toaster oven and plywood mold, I began making 6" x 6" sheets. Once cooled, these sheets could be shaped and assembled just like wood. And thus, the first planters where born! </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Recently, the kind folks at The Innovation Barn in Charlotte have allowed me to use their equipment to ramp up production. In just 5 days, I to processed 40 lbs of waste down to 1/4 in flake - the ideal size for efficent heating and reshaping. Soon, I'll be able to produce polypropyline planters efficently and consistantly - allowing me to begin selling and collecting more waste steams! <br>

										<h2>reShape PlasticWorks <br> 
										I founded this startup with a singlular goal - less waste, more plants. To date I've recycled just over 3kg of polypropeline and PLA into planters.<br>
										I've since teamed up with The Innovation Barn in Charlotte to further this goal. Click the image for more plant pictures!</h2>
